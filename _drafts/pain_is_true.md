title: Pain is Truth
---

What is good? Truth is good. Truth is the way, the only way.
What is true? Pain is true, pain is real. You can't avoid it, no matter how much you try. So you better accept it and embrace it. Acceptance is the transformation of your beliefs to better map the world. Truth rarely doesn't hurt. Acceptance rarely doesn't hurt. Transformation rarely doesn't hurt.

And so pain is what gives meaning to live.

Stop doing things that make you feel weak. Stop lying to reality.

What am I? I am the capacity for transformation of myself.

What do I want to be? The rock against the storm.
