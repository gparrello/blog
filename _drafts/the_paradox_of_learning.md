Human experience can be organized in a graphic depicting a center (you) surrounded by a circular barrier (what you know), surrounded by another theoretical circular barrier (what you don't know), located inside the space of everything that can be known. Everything that is outside the second barrier is what you don't know that you don't know, and this second barrier is theoretical only because the limit is also unknowable - you can't know where each type of unknown lives until you explore it and it crosses your known limit (first barrier).


The bigger you make the circle of "what you know", the scarcer you become. There is only so much people that can handle that much truth and the funnel becomes slimmer and slimmer.

The bigger your order circle becomes, the more general your ideas become too, so you can apply them to more aspects of life generally. That means you can move across different hierarchies more easily and it has a compounding effect.
