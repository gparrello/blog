title: The Prisoner's Dilemma of Dating
---

I guess there comes a moment in the life of every person in which they decide what they want from a relationship with a partner. And for each person involved, there are two options:
- either to keep the options open in case something better comes along
- or not and to commit to the other

Then you would think, from a rational perspective, what is the best scenario that you can put yourself in? And that is, obviously, the one in which you keep your options open and the other person commits.

But that only works short term. It obviously umbalanced.
