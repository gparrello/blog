title: Burn the Dead Wood
---

I was trying to figure out who I was and how that could be fixed, something like that. I started to pay very careful attention to what I was saying. I don't know if that happened voluntarily or involuntarily but I could feel a sort of split developing in my psyche, split into two let's say, and one part was the old me that was talking a lot and that liked to argue and that liked ideas, and there was another part that was watching that part just with its eyes open and neutrally judging.

And the part that was neutrally judging was watching the part that was talking and going "that isn't your idea", "you don't really believe that", "you don't really know what you're talking about", "that isn't true"... And I thought "hmm that's really interesting". So now that was happening to like 95% of what I was saying and so then I didn't really know what to do! I thought "okay this is strange, so maybe I've fragmented and that's just not a good thing at all"...

So then I had this weird conundrum, it's like, well which of those two things are me? Is it the part that's listening and saying "no that's rubbish, that's a lie, you're doing that to impress people, you're just trying to win the argument", you know? Was that me or was the part that was going about my normal verbal business me? And I didn't know but I decided I would go with the critic, and then what I learned to do, I think, was to stop saying things that made me WEAK.

I'm still trying to do that because I'm always feeling when I talk whether or not the words that I'm saying are either making me align or making me come apart. But I decided that I would start practicing not saying things that would make me weak and what happened was that I had to stop saying almost everything that I was saying, I would say 95% of it... It's a hell of a shock to wake up and realize that you're mostly dead wood, it's a shock, you know! And you might think, well, do you really want all of that to burn off? There's nothing left but a little 5% of you, but if that 5% is solid then maybe that's exactly what you want to have happen.
