why don't friends with benefits work?

Let's say we start seeing each other in a romantic manner. We have dates, we spend time together. We get to know each other, we are vulnerable to each other because we share intimacy, which needs not necessarily be only in the form of sex.

What happens as a consequence is what you would call having a relationship: I assume you want to spend more time with me (because you're spending time with me already) and, likewise, you assume the same from me for the same reason. This is foundation of trust.

Why is it time the fact that determines that trust is created? There's nothing more valuable than time because it is limited. Your time is finite because you're going to die. So the ultimate sacrifice you can do for someone is to give them your time.

and giving time is paying attention.

In so far sacrifice is what gives value to anything, as sacrificing something means prioritizing something else, valuing something else, then the sacrifice of time to attend to someone is valuing someone.


you either like someone as a whole or you don't

you think that just because you warn someone that you don't want to be with them it's okay to use them

you think that saying stuff is enough to shrug responsibility



Friends with benefits do not exist. They are not real. It's just two people dating that do not want to see or take on the responsibility of and have cknsideration for the person they are sleeping with, essentially reducing the other to what is commonly called a fuck-buddy. A provider of short-term sexual gratification at most.

If you don't intend to date someone, you are planning for heartbreak; it may not be yours, but it doesn't matter. Whatever you do to someone else, you do to yourself.
