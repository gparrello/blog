title: Friends with Benefits
--

Friends with benefits do not exist. They are not real. And the reason is simple:

Friends with benefits are just two people dating that do not want to take on the responsibility and consideration of the person they are sleeping with. Essentially reducing the other to what is commonly called a fuck-buddy.

why don't be friends with benefits work?

Let's say we start seeing each other; I assume you want to be with me because you're spending time with me and, likewise, you assume I to be with you becaut I'm spending time with you.

so why is it time the fact that determines that we assume that we want to be with each other?

because there's nothing more valuable than time why? because your time is finite because you're going to die so the ultimate sacrifice that you can do for someone is to give them your time (and giving your time entails giving your attention)

in so far sacrifice is what gives value to anything then the sacrifice of time to attend to someone is valuing someone.

you either like someone as a whole or you don't

you think that just because you warn someone that you don't want to be with them it's okay to use them

you think that saying stuff is enough to shrug responsibility


if you don't intend to date someone, you are planning for heartbreak; it may not be yours but it doesn't matter
everything you do to others, you so to yourself
