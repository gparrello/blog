title: "No Such Thing as Halfway"
---

There is not such thing as a casual relationship, a serious relationship or anything in between. There is only relationships, and effort.

The only difference to be appreciated is either you are putting in effort into the relationship because you like someone
or you are putting in effort for someone to like you.
The first comes from abundance and should be encouraged, the second comes from scarcity and should be avoided.
