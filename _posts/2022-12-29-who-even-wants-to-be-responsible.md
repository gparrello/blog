title: Who The Fuck Wants To Be Responsible
---

It's not really like I WANT a girlfriend, who wants that?!
I don't want the responsibility,
I just want the good parts,
like everyone else...

But my experience has made it clear
that avoiding the responsibility
from any relationship
inevitably leads to heartbreak,
on either or both parts.
And that's a waaay heavier load down the line.
