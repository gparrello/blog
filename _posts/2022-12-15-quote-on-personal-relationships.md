"There really is no greater satisfaction
that you can imagine
than that kind of personal relationship
wherein you can trust a being,
who is other than you
and not under your control,
to do for you what you want
because they like it.
And you on your side would want
to do something for them that way,
so as to give pleasure to the other person."

___
_Alan Watts_
