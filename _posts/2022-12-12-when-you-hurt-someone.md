title: When You Hurt Someone
---

Every time you hurt someone, you accrue a kindness debt.
This is what makes you ashamed: you could have done better, you could have been more, you could have aimed towards Good.

But you didn't. You missed the mark.

And the result is pain.
That's how your mind teaches you not to repeat the same mistake.
